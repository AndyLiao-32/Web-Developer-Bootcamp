<h1>This is my first tag!!!</h1>

<p><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> has made an impact in almost every industrial sector, and <em>civil engineering</em> is now joining the bandwagon as well. According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $10 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, until recently, the industry had been relatively under digitised. </p>

<p>This is because <em>civil engineering</em> is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence.</p>
